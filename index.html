            <p>
                Hello, welcome to 'Grail', a musical rhythm-game. 
            </p>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p> 
                This single level scene has been developed to test research questions relating to my PhD research on sonic expression and immersion. The links below will take you to 1 of 2 versions of the game. You are asked to play both, but the order has been randomised. It has been developed to work on a Quest2 with your 2 controllers.
            </p> 
            <p>
                For each version of the game you will be asked to respond to a survey. Each survey will take around 10 minutes to fill out. You will then find a link below to take you to the other version of the game you did not play. You will be asked to fill out the same survey for that version of the game. Please complete both surveys, the data isn't useful for me if you only play one. I am very grateful for your time, you will make a tired PhD student happy :)
            </p>
            <h3>Game info</h3>
            <p>
                The aim of the game is to shoot lasers from your hand controllers to destroy the blocks before they hit you. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                If you get hit by a block you will take damage and your screen will start to become red and flash! Take too much damage and you will lose and the game will stop.
            </p>
